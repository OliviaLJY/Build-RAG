## 🚀 How It Works Now

### When Documents ARE Found:
```
Question: "What is RAG?"
    ↓
Search YOUR documents → Found 5 documents
    ↓
GPT-4o generates answer FROM your documents
    ↓
✅ Answer with source documents
```

### When Documents are NOT Found:
```
Question: "Who is president of France?"
    ↓
Search YOUR documents → Found 0 documents
    ↓
Check: allow_general_knowledge = True
    ↓
GPT-4o answers from its training knowledge
    ↓

## 🎛️ How to Control This Feature

### Option 1: In Code (Python)

```python
from src.rag_pipeline import RAGPipeline
from src.config import RAGConfig

# Enable general knowledge (default)
config = RAGConfig(allow_general_knowledge=True)
rag = RAGPipeline(config)

# Disable general knowledge (strict mode)
config = RAGConfig(allow_general_knowledge=False)
rag = RAGPipeline(config)
```

### Option 2: In Production Server

Edit `api_server_production.py` line 302:

```python
config = RAGConfig(
    # ... other settings ...
    allow_general_knowledge=True,  # Change to False for strict mode
)
```

### Option 3: Via Environment Variable (Future Enhancement)

Could add to `.env`:
```bash
ALLOW_GENERAL_KNOWLEDGE=true  # or false
```

---

## 🔍 How to Identify Knowledge Source

Each response now includes a `knowledge_source` field:

```python
result = rag.query("Your question")

if result.get('knowledge_source') == 'general_knowledge':
    print("⚠️ Answer from GPT-4o's training")
elif result.get('knowledge_source') == 'documents':
    print("✅ Answer from your documents")
else:
    print("📚 Answer from documents (default)")
```

In the frontend, answers from general knowledge include:
> ℹ️ **Note:** No relevant documents found in knowledge base...

## ⚖️ When to Use Each Mode

### ✅ Use `allow_general_knowledge=True` (Default)

**Best for:**
- General-purpose AI assistant
- Q&A systems where some questions might be off-topic
- Customer support (can handle unexpected questions)
- Educational chatbots
- Personal assistants

**Pros:**
- More user-friendly
- Can answer any question
- Clear disclaimer when using general knowledge
- Better user experience

**Cons:**
- May provide outdated info (GPT-4o training cutoff ~Oct 2023)
- Can't verify general knowledge answers
- Might hallucinate for obscure topics

---

### 🔒 Use `allow_general_knowledge=False` (Strict Mode)

**Best for:**
- Legal document Q&A (only use verified sources)
- Medical information systems
- Compliance/regulatory systems
- Internal knowledge bases (company policies, etc.)
- Academic research (only cite specific papers)
- Financial advice (only use verified data)

**Pros:**
- Never hallucinates
- All answers traceable to sources
- Strict accuracy guarantee
- Verifiable information only

**Cons:**
- Can't answer off-topic questions
- Less flexible
- May frustrate users with "I don't know" responses

## 💡 Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Mixed Questions

```python
config = RAGConfig(allow_general_knowledge=True)
rag = RAGPipeline(config)
rag.load_existing_store()

# User asks about your docs
result1 = rag.query("What is RAG?")
# ✅ Answered from documents (5 sources)

# User asks general question
result2 = rag.query("What's the weather in Paris?")
# ✅ Answered from general knowledge (with disclaimer)
```

### Scenario 2: Strict Document-Only

```python
config = RAGConfig(allow_general_knowledge=False)
rag = RAGPipeline(config)
rag.load_existing_store()

# User asks about your docs
result1 = rag.query("What is RAG?")
# ✅ Answered from documents

# User asks general question
result2 = rag.query("What's the weather in Paris?")
# ❌ "I couldn't find relevant information..."
```

---

## 🔄 How to Switch Modes

### Temporarily (in code):
```python
# Enable for this session
rag.config.allow_general_knowledge = True

# Disable for this session
rag.config.allow_general_knowledge = False
```

### Permanently (in config):
Edit `src/config.py` line 51:
```python
allow_general_knowledge: bool = Field(
    default=True,  # Change to False here
    ...
)
```

---

## 🚀 Production Server Status

**Current Setting:** ✅ `allow_general_knowledge=True` (enabled)

To apply changes to your running server:
```bash
# Restart the server
pkill -f "uvicorn api_server_production"
uvicorn api_server_production:app --reload --port 8000 &
```

Or use the startup script:
```bash
./start_production.sh
```

## 📊 Code Changes Summary

### Before (Lines 183-187):
```python
if not documents:
    return {
        "answer": "I couldn't find any relevant information...",
        "source_documents": []
    }
# ❌ Never reached GPT-4o without documents
```

### After (Lines 192-227):
```python
if not documents:
    if self.config.allow_general_knowledge:
        # Answer from GPT-4o with disclaimer
        answer = llm.predict(general_prompt)
        return {
            "answer": f"ℹ️ Note: ... {answer}",
            "source_documents": [],
            "knowledge_source": "general_knowledge"
        }
    else:
        # Strict mode
        return {
            "answer": "I couldn't find...",
            "source_documents": [],
            "knowledge_source": "none"
        }
# ✅ Configurable behavior
```

---

## ✅ Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Configurable:** Toggle between modes easily
2. **Transparent:** Clear disclaimer when using general knowledge
3. **Safe:** Default behavior is user-friendly but honest
4. **Flexible:** Can switch modes per use case
5. **Backward Compatible:** Setting to False restores old behavior
6. **Informative:** Adds `knowledge_source` field to responses
