| Embeddings | sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | **text-embedding-3-large** ‚ú® |
| Temperature | 0.7 | **0.3** (more accurate) |
| Max Tokens | 2000 | **4000** (more detailed) |
| Hybrid Search | ‚ùå | **‚úÖ** |
| Contextual Compression | ‚ùå | **‚úÖ** |

## üéØ Expected Improvements

### Better Answers
- More comprehensive and accurate responses
- Better understanding of complex questions
- Improved technical explanations
- More contextually relevant information

### Smarter Retrieval
- Better semantic matching with queries
- More relevant document retrieval
- Improved handling of nuanced questions
- Better multi-concept queries

### Enhanced Reasoning
- Clearer logical flow in answers
- Better synthesis of information
- Improved handling of ambiguous questions
- More insightful connections between concepts

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment File
Rename your `env` file to `.env` (with a dot):
```bash
mv env .env
```

### 2. Install/Update Dependencies
Make sure you have python-dotenv installed:
```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

### 3. Test the Enhanced System
Run the test script:
```bash
python test_intelligent_rag.py
```

### 4. Start Production Server
```bash
uvicorn api_server_production:app --reload --port 8000
```

Or use the start script:
```bash
./start_production.sh
```

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

### GPT-4o Pricing (as of 2024)
- Input: ~$5 per 1M tokens
- Output: ~$15 per 1M tokens

### text-embedding-3-large
- ~$0.13 per 1M tokens

### Tips to Manage Costs
1. **Use caching** (already enabled) - repeated questions use cached responses
2. **Shorter context** - adjust `top_k_retrieval` if needed
3. **Hybrid approach** - use GPT-4o for complex queries, fallback to GPT-3.5-turbo for simple ones
4. **Monitor usage** - check your OpenAI dashboard

## üìà Testing & Validation

### Test Different Query Types
1. **Factual Questions**: "What is X?"
2. **Comparison Questions**: "What's the difference between X and Y?"
3. **How-to Questions**: "How does X work?"
4. **Complex Questions**: Multi-part questions requiring reasoning

### Example Test
```python
from src.rag_pipeline import RAGPipeline
from src.config import RAGConfig

# Initialize with enhanced config
config = RAGConfig()  # Uses GPT-4o by default now
rag = RAGPipeline(config)
rag.load_existing_store()

# Ask a complex question
result = rag.query("Explain how transformers work in deep learning and compare them to RNNs")
print(result['answer'])
```

## üîß Customization

### If you want to adjust the balance between intelligence and cost:

#### Option 1: Use GPT-4o-mini (cheaper, still very good)
```python
config = RAGConfig(
    llm_model="gpt-4o-mini",  # More affordable
    embedding_model="text-embedding-3-small"  # Cheaper embeddings
)
```

#### Option 2: Hybrid approach
Use GPT-4o for production, GPT-3.5-turbo for development/testing.

#### Option 3: Keep embeddings, use GPT-3.5-turbo for generation
```python
config = RAGConfig(
    llm_model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # Cheaper generation
    embedding_model="text-embedding-3-large"  # Keep good retrieval
)
```

## üìö What Changed in the Code

### 1. `src/config.py`
- Added `dotenv` loading
- Changed default LLM to `gpt-4o`
- Changed default embeddings to `text-embedding-3-large`
- Reduced temperature to 0.3
- Increased max_tokens to 4000

### 2. `src/rag_pipeline.py`
- Enhanced prompt with detailed instructions
- Better reasoning guidelines
- More structured response format

### 3. `api_server_production.py`
- Updated default configuration
- Enabled hybrid search
- Enabled contextual compression
- Added intelligent model configuration

## üéâ Benefits You'll See

1. **More Accurate Answers**: GPT-4o understands context better
2. **Better Retrieval**: OpenAI embeddings find more relevant documents
3. **Clearer Explanations**: Enhanced prompts guide the AI to explain better
4. **Improved Reasoning**: Better logical connections and insights
5. **Technical Precision**: More accurate with technical terms and concepts

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If you get "API key not found" error:
1. Make sure your file is named `.env` (not `env`)
2. Check that the file contains: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...`
3. Restart your Python script/server after changing the file

### If you get rate limit errors:
1. Check your OpenAI account has credits
2. Reduce `max_tokens` if needed
3. Use caching to reduce API calls

### If responses are too long/short:
- Adjust `max_tokens` in the config
- Modify `temperature` (lower = more focused, higher = more creative)

## üìû Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Test with `test_intelligent_rag.py`
2. ‚úÖ Start your production server
3. ‚úÖ Try complex questions to see the improvement
4. ‚úÖ Monitor your OpenAI usage dashboard
5. ‚úÖ Adjust configuration based on your needs
