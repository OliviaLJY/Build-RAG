## 💡 Key Concepts Explained

### 1. REST API
```
GET    /api/resource       → Retrieve data
POST   /api/resource       → Create new data
PUT    /api/resource/{id}  → Update data
DELETE /api/resource/{id}  → Delete data
```

### 2. FastAPI Route
```python
@app.post("/api/query")
async def query_rag(request: QueryRequest):
    # Process request
    return response
```

### 3. Pydantic Validation
```python
class QueryRequest(BaseModel):
    question: str = Field(..., min_length=1)
    user_id: Optional[str] = None
```

### 4. Database Operations
```python
conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO ...")
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

### 5. Error Handling
```python
if error_condition:
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=400,
        detail="Error message"
    )
```

## 🎓 Tips for Success

1. **Read Comments First**
   - Every TODO has detailed instructions
   - Hints are provided for tricky parts
   - Don't skip the explanations!

2. **Test Incrementally**
   - Implement one method at a time
   - Test after each implementation
   - Use print() for debugging

3. **Study the Example**
   - `api_server.py` has working code
   - See how similar problems are solved
   - Copy patterns, not code

4. **Use Type Hints**
   ```python
   def get(self, query: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
   ```

5. **Handle Errors**
   ```python
   try:
       # Your code
   except Exception as e:
       logger.error(f"Error: {e}")
   ```

6. **Google is Your Friend**
   - Look up unfamiliar functions
